# Prerequisites

1. A basic understanding of the [markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
2. You will need to create a free [github](https://github.com/) account if you don't have one. Recommend you use the name of your RPG as this will become part of the URL people will use to access your SRD. 
3. You can do this whole process through the browser without knowing git. Though  learning github desktop will allow you to test any changes locally before deploying them live for the world to see.

> If you have a domain name registered, you can't use this with this process to create an SRD like I have https://srd.7thextinctionrpg.com
